# intent-demo-for-kivy

A minimal demo to test intents with kivy

## Disclaimer

The IOS code wasn't already tested.

The Android code works and was tested.

## Test intent filters

### test with urls

you can open the app with two urls schemes:

* [http://myapp.org/blablabla](http://myapp.org/blablabla)
* <a href="myapp://blablabla">myapp://blablabla</a>

For some mobile browsers like firefox, you'll have to 'open in an application' with a long tap on the link.

### test with barcodes (to open app with a barcode scanner)
